# Mini Project - Data Analysis

## Topic: Food Retail Analysis

### Association Rule Mining
Market Basket Analysis is one of the key techniques used by large retailers to uncover associations between items. It works by looking for combinations of items that occur together frequently in transactions. To put it another way, it allows retailers to identify relationships between the items that people buy.

Association Rules are widely used to analyze retail basket or transaction data and are intended to identify strong rules discovered in transaction data using measures of interestingness, based on the concept of strong rules.

### Details of the dataset
The dataset has 5,197,681 rows of the purchase orders of people from the food retail stores. These orders can be analysed and association rules can be generated using Market Basket Analysis by algorithms like Apriori Algorithm.

### Apriori Algorithm
Apriori is an algorithm for frequent itemset mining and association rule learning over relational databases. It proceeds by identifying the frequent individual items in the database and extending them to larger and larger item sets as long as those item sets appear sufficiently often in the database. The frequent itemsets determined by Apriori can be used to determine association rules which highlight general trends in the database: this has applications in domains such as market basket analysis.
