## Topic: ETL Pipeline

ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load, and it is a process used in data warehousing and analytics to move data from source systems to a target system, transforming it along the way. In the context of AWS (Amazon Web Services), there are various services and tools that can be used for ETL processes.
- **Extract** retrieves the CSV data from S3.
- **Transform** processes the data, extracting customer information.
- **Load** uploads the transformed data (in Parquet format) back to S3 in a specified location.
