# BIG DATA SYSTEM DESIGN

### Explanation:
In a notable leadership role, I spearheaded a collaborative effort among a team of dedicated students to conceptualize and design an innovative big data system for a specific project. Tasked with harnessing the power of data analytics to address project requirements, our team navigated the complexities of designing a robust and scalable system. Leveraging the diverse skills within the group, we seamlessly integrated each team member's expertise to create a cohesive solution. From the initial planning stages to the implementation phase, I guided the team in defining system architecture, selecting appropriate technologies, and ensuring the seamless integration of big data methodologies. The experience not only showcased our collective ability to tackle intricate challenges but also underscored the importance of effective teamwork in the successful development of a comprehensive big data solution.

### TOPIC: KEEPING A PROMISES
Stark Industry is planning to distribute a small model of Arc Reactor for household use.
Chairperson promises to the users with 24/7 availability. So, they have to monitor for the remaining lifetime of the reactor and send a new one for replacement before failure occurred. In initial phase, 1000 unit of the reactor have been tested and the result are stored on the main database of the company. In upcoming public release of the reactor, the marketing team expected over 1000000 unit will be sold. You, as the maintenance team, decides to use survival analysis to predicts remaining lifetime of the reactor. They have to do this daily to ensure minimum failure. Arc reactor comes with the feature to send their
current condition to the headquarter. So, they will have to design a new system to aggregate the data and predicts the remaining lifetime of each unit.

In summary, you will have to design a maintenance system that:
• Capable of aggregating data from over 1000000 units.
• Predicts remaining lifetime of each unit using Survival Analysis. Predicts daily.
• Update the survival analysis parameters from collected data every week.
• Generate the report of the maintenance process to the chairperson every week.
